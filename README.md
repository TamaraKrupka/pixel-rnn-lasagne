## PixelRNN

 A lasagne implementation of the MD-RNN proposed in the paper ["Pixel Recurrent Neural Networks"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1601.06759) by AÃ¤ron van den Oord, Nal Kalchbrenner and Koray Kavukcuoglu

### Overview

This repository features:
* Bi-Diag-LSTM
* Masked convolutions (also color channel masking)
* !! Proper shift down by 1 row of the right Diag-LSTM
* Residual connections
* Networks weights for MNIST
* 256-way softmax and sigmoid output layers
* Dynamic generation of MNIST images in an updating `matplotlib` window

TODO:
* ConvCNN
* Pyramid-RNN (Row-RNN)
* Train on CIFAR-10

The PixelRNN implementation can converge to a decent solution in a few epochs of training on MNIST.

### Examples

Images sampled (generated) from the Bi-Diag-LSTM:

![Generated](./data/generated/generated.jpg)

Original images (left) and the same images with their lower half completed by the Bi-Diag-LSTM (right):

![Original](./data/generated/originals.jpg) ![Completed](./data/generated/completed.jpg)

Three steps of the dynamic pixel-by-pixel generation of an image:

<img src="data/generated/generation_part1.png" alt="Part1" style="width: 200px;"/>
<img src="data/generated/generation_part2.png" alt="Part2" style="width: 200px;"/>
<img src="data/generated/generation_part3.png" alt="Part3" style="width: 200px;"/>
